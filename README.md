# KPS POS system

## Setup

1. Download and install Node.js (LTS) from <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">here</a>
2. Make a new folder where you will put the website contents. Anywhere in your computer will do. For demonstaration, we will use `kps` (You may change the name, if you want)
3. Clone this repository to that `kps` folder
4. Run terminal/cmd from `kps` folder
5. Type in `npm install`. This will download and install all the needed modules for the website.
6. Still in terminal/cmd, type `node server.js`. This will start the local server for the website

You can now view the site my going to <a href="https://www.localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> in your browser. <strong>Make sure that the server is always started before you do this by doing `node server.js` in terminal/cmd in `kps` directory</strong>
